ABC 3 

PQRS 4

*Explanation*

When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with the respective lengths 3,3,4,3,3,4, and 33. The longest-named city is obviously PQRS, but there are 33 options for shortest-named city; we choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.

```sql
select city, length(city) from station order by length(city) DESC,city ASC fetch first row only;
select city, length(city) from station order by length(city) asc ,city asc fetch first row only;
